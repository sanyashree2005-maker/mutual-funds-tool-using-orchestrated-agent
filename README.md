# 🤖 Agentic AI – Mutual Fund Analyzer

This project implements a **tool-orchestrated agentic AI system** that analyzes mutual fund datasets, ranks funds using deterministic financial logic, and generates **clear, human-readable explanations** using a Large Language Model (LLM).

The system focuses on **explainability, transparency, and flexibility**, making it suitable for academic and demonstration purposes.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Investors often find it difficult to analyze mutual fund data due to:
- Large number of funds
- Multiple financial metrics
- Lack of explainability in automated systems

The goal of this project is to design an intelligent system that can:
- Analyze mutual fund datasets
- Rank funds objectively
- Explain recommendations in simple language

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a **tool-orchestrated agentic AI system**
- Rank mutual funds using deterministic logic
- Use LLMs only for explanation (not decision-making)
- Reduce hallucination and improve trust
- Provide an interactive web interface

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

The system follows a **single-agent tool orchestration architecture**, where one controller manages multiple tools.
